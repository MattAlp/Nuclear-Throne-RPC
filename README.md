About this project
======
This **_WORK IN PROGRESS_** Python script serves as an interface between the [Nuclear Throne Stream Key API](http://nuclearthrone.com/streamkey/) and the [Discord Rich Presence API](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence).

Essentially, it gives you a detailed Discord status with current run information in real-time, obtained from Vlambeer's servers every 15 seconds, as shown below:
