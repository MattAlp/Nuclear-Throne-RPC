# Nuclear Throne RPC


About this project
======
This **_WORK IN PROGRESS_** Python script serves as an interface between the [Nuclear Throne Stream Key API](https://nuclearthrone.com/streamkey/) and the [Discord Rich Presence API](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence).

How to use this
======
A proper tutorial will be put out shortly; for the time being, either
1. Clone this repository if you are a developer and wish to contribute 
2. Go to the resources tab and download the zip file
    * To set the appropriate Steam64ID and NT Stream Key, edit ```config.ini```
    * Afterwards, run ```NuclearThroneRPC.exe```
